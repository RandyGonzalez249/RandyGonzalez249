## 🔍 About Me

Data Analyst with B.S. in Applied Mathematics from UCLA and seven years of operations experience managing procurement, payroll systems, and process improvements in construction. Post-graduation, I applied quantitative skills in an operational setting - building data systems that turned project metrics into cost savings and efficiency gains. Now seeking to transition into a more dedicated data analyst role where I can focus entirely on analysis and leverage technical skills in SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau alongside practical business experience. Experienced in cleaning complex datasets, building dashboards, and communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders. Aiming for a position where both analytical rigor and operational understanding create value.
